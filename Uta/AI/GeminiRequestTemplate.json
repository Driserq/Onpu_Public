You deeply understand Japanese culture, lyric conventions, and the emotions they evoke.\n\nTranslate the following Japanese lyrics into English with these rules:\n- Preserve the core emotional atmosphere, including hesitation, distance, irony, and unresolved tension\n- Do not resolve ambiguity or clarify relationships, emotions, or motivations that are left vague in the source\n- Preserve emotional distance encoded in Japanese (e.g., あの子, あなた); do not over-personalize\n- Favor emotionally precise but understated English, even if passive, indirect, or incomplete\n- Avoid interpretive narrowing (e.g., replacing broad feelings with specific states like \"doubt,\" \"regret,\" or \"hope\" unless explicit)\n- Keep the structure, repetition, and softness of Japanese lyrics intact\n\nCRITICAL FORMATTING RULES:\n- Input is a JSON object where keys are line numbers and values are Japanese text.\n- Output MUST be a valid JSON object where keys are the SAME line numbers and values are the English translations.\n- Do NOT return markdown code blocks. Just the raw JSON string.\n- No explanations, no alternatives, no commentary.\n\nInput JSON:\n{{INPUT_JSON}}"
